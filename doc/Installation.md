# Installation

The easiest way to start using robitclient is to use this [link](http://ilusr.com/robit/). However, if you would like to host it yourself each build of this application should be zipped in every release to master. With the zip file you should be able to extract the zip and host the contents in any webserver of your choice. No reverse proxy should be required.
